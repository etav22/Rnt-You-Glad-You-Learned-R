# R'nt You Glad You Learned R
I created this repository to practice my R skills in preparation for the 
upcoming statistics course for my master's degree at UC Berkeley. 

## Contents
This repo houses different R-markdown notebooks on different datasets that I found interesting/challenging. As I complete a new notebook, I'll reference on in this README. To this point, I've crafted the following notebooks:

  - [`world_cup`](notebooks/world_cup.md) (Completed 🏁)
  - [`super_bowl_ads`](notebooks/super_bowl_ads.md) (Completed 🏁)

More to come : )
