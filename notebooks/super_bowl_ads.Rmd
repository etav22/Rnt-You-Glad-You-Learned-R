# Background
This notebook focuses on super bowl ads data! Again, this data is retrieved
from the `tidy-tuesday` collection. 

To give a general overview, this dataset was curated by the team at 
[FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/). Per their [article](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/super-bowl-ads/) (which I will
refrain from reading to have a true explanatory experience), they describe how
they composed this dataset:

> We watched 233 ads from the 10 brands that aired the most spots in all 
21 Super Bowls this century, according to superbowl-ads.com.1 While we watched, 
we evaluated ads using seven specific criteria, marking every spot as a "yes" 
or "no" for each.

For more information the dataset itself and
the characteristics, feel free to check it out [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-03-02/readme.md)

# Setup

First, let's load the libraries and data:
```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidytuesdayR) # library from which we'll retrieve the data
library(patchwork)
library(stringr)
library(reshape2)
library(scales)
# Let's also set a theme for our plots
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

Now let's load the data from `tidy-tuesday` (March 2nd, 2021):
```{r message=FALSE}
super_bowl_ads <- tt_load('2021-03-02')
super_bowl_ads <- super_bowl_ads$youtube
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

To begin, I like to just take a quick gander at the data to see what it looks
like:
```{r}
head(super_bowl_ads)
```

Immediately, there are a couple of columns I'd like to drop that really won't be
useful for analysis. Those columns are:

  - `superbowl_ads_dot_com_url`
  - `youtube_url`
  - `etag`
  - `thumbnail`

I'm removing these columns since these columns are metadata that won't add any
sort of value to our analyses.
```{r}
super_bowl_ads <- subset(
  super_bowl_ads, 
  select = -c(superbowl_ads_dot_com_url,
              youtube_url,
              etag,
              thumbnail)
  )
```

Having removed those columns, let's take a quick look to see if we have any 
abnormalities like `NaN` values:
```{r}
sapply(super_bowl_ads, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

We find that there are several missing values in the `kind` and `view_count`
which will make analyzing those rows impossible. So let's look at those rows 
and make sure that we can drop them.

```{r}
# Show the number of rows in the dataframe
print(nrow(super_bowl_ads))

# Let's just drop the columns which have either missing views, and like_counts
# since those are the most important from an analysis point of views
super_bowl_ads <- super_bowl_ads[!is.na(super_bowl_ads$view_count), ]
super_bowl_ads <- super_bowl_ads[!is.na(super_bowl_ads$like_count), ]

# Let's view the missing values again:
sapply(super_bowl_ads, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
print(nrow(super_bowl_ads))
```

In total, we dropped about **22 observations**, which is not too many considering
we started with 247 observations (less than 10%).

With our data relatively clean (for analysis), let's formulate a list of 
questions we can answer regarding this dataset:

1. Are certain types of commercials associated with a specific type of brand?
How has the type of commercials changed over time?
2. What are the most popular commercials? We can determine this by the number 
of views that a video received and furthermore, we can do some feature
engineering to further define other sorts of superlatives (most controversial,
likeable, etc.)
3. Does having more categories help or hurt a commercial? Tying in with question
2, do the most popular commercials typically have two or more categories? Or are
they more focused on one single category?
engineering to determine which ads have been wildly popular, controversial, etc.
4. How well does youtube's categorization match that of the FiveThirtyEight
team? 

Within each question, we will likely have further sub-questions, but for now, 
let's get started 🏃🏽‍♂️!

### 1. Ad categories over time

The categories that we're working with are:

- `funny`
- `show_product_quickly`
- `patriotic`
- `celebrity`
- `danger`
- `animals`
- `use_sex`

Some of these are more subjective than others (`funny`, `show_product_quickly`), 
but we'll trust the team at FiveThirtyEight has a good sense of humor and is 
relatively impatient 😉. 

First, let's look at who our 10 brands are 
```{r}
unique(super_bowl_ads$brand)
```

We have:

- 3 car brands
- 5 food/beverage brands
- 1 financial brand
- 1 sports brand

Before looking at the ad categories, how is the distribution of ads amongst the
brands?
```{r}
super_bowl_ads %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  summarize(total_ads = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_ads))
```

We can already see that the number of ads are heavily skewed towards 
our food/beverage brands. So when we look at the categories of each of the
different ads, we should consider some sort of percentage to combat the 
disparity in the number of ads between each brand.

Let's go ahead and now create this grouping for our different categories:
```{r}
# Group the columns by each category
group_category_by_brand <- super_bowl_ads %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  summarize(
    funny = sum(funny),
    show_product_quickly = sum(show_product_quickly),
    patriotic = sum(patriotic), 
    celebrity = sum(celebrity),
    danger = sum(danger),
    animals = sum(animals),
    use_sex = sum(use_sex))

# Convert tible to dataframe
group_category_by_brand <- as.data.frame(group_category_by_brand)

group_category_by_brand
```

Having generated this table, let's make a useful visualization out of it to 
extract greater meaning from it. However, to make said visualization, we'll need
to use the `melt` function from `reshape2` to make it usable:

```{r}
# Melt all the values from the dataframe to create a new one
melt_df <- melt(group_category_by_brand, id.vars = 1)

# Generate a grouped barplot
ggplot(
  data = melt_df,
  aes(x = value, y = reorder(brand, +value))) + 
  geom_bar(
    aes(fill = variable),
    stat = "identity",
    position = "stack") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Spectral") + 
  labs(
    title = "Funny Bud Light Ads are in Abundance!",
    x = "Number of Ads",
    y = "Brand"
  )
```

This is quite a nice and informative graph. We can see that the majority of the
ads are Bud Light ones and that they always tend to be funny and show their 
product quickly. Already from this graph, we can see that the majority of the 
ads are funny ones, but let's look at the distribution of ads across the 
different groupings:

```{r}
# Get the sums of each column
sum_df <- as.data.frame(
  as.list(
    colSums(Filter(is.numeric, group_category_by_brand))
  )
)

# Transpose the dataframe and make the index a new row called category
sum_df <- t(sum_df)
sum_df <- as.data.frame(cbind(category = rownames(sum_df), sum_df))
colnames(sum_df)[2] ="count"
sum_df$count = as.numeric(sum_df$count)

# Create the bar plot
sum_df %>%
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = reorder(category, -count), y = count) + 
  geom_bar(
    stat = "identity",
    fill = '#3388bd') + 
  labs(
    title = "Show them Quick and Make them Funny!",
    x = "Category",
    y = "Number of Ads"
  )
```

Ads which are funny and show the product quickly are the most prominent types of
ads amongst the biggest brands! From a general perspective, that is how super
bowl ads are typically thought of. 

However, while those are all nice sets of graphs, we still don't have a 
definitive answer to what types of ads do companies use. Let's answer that 
with certainty now:
```{r}
# Set up plotting space
brand_names <- as.list(group_category_by_brand$brand)

# Generate a list to house the plot
plots <- list()

for (i in brand_names) { # Loop over loop.vector
  
  # Subset the dataframe
  df_subset <- melt_df[melt_df$brand == i, ]

  # store data in column.i as x
  plot <- df_subset %>%
    ggplot() + 
    aes(x = brand, y = value) + 
    geom_bar(
      aes(fill = variable),
      stat = "identity",
      position = "dodge"
    ) + 
    scale_fill_brewer(palette="Spectral") + 
    labs(
      x = "Brand",
      y = "Number of Ads"
    )
  
  # Return the plot objects
  print(plot)
}

```

Here are the most interesting items I found from these plots

1. Budweiser has a large number of ads using animals which is not
common across the board. This makes sense as they have their famous
clydesdales’ commercials which have become a staple in the Super
Bowl lineup
2. The food/beverage companies show their products quickly and try
to do so comedically. The one notable point here is that Pepsi
loves to use celebrities in its commercials. 
3. NFL stays away from commercials involving danger, sex, or
animals - for a professional organization, I’d say this checks out.
4. Surprisingly, a car brand, KIA, uses sex quite frequently in
their ads. 

As the final part of this subquestion, I want to look at how ads have changed
over time. To do this, we'll need to first group the ads by year and then
reproduce our `melt` method from before to generate a plot:
```{r}
# Group the columns by each category
group_category_by_year <- super_bowl_ads %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(
    funny = sum(funny),
    show_product_quickly = sum(show_product_quickly),
    patriotic = sum(patriotic), 
    celebrity = sum(celebrity),
    danger = sum(danger),
    animals = sum(animals),
    use_sex = sum(use_sex))

# Convert tible to dataframe
group_category_by_year <- as.data.frame(group_category_by_year)

# Melt all the values from the dataframe to create a new one
melt_df_year <- melt(group_category_by_year, id.vars = 1)

# Generate a grouped barplot
ggplot(
  data = melt_df_year,
  aes(x = year, y = value))+ 
  geom_bar(
    aes(fill = variable),
    stat = "identity",
    position = "stack") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Spectral") +
  labs(
    title = "No Discernable Pattern Across Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Ads"
  )
```

As noted in the title of the graph, there doesn't seem to be any discernable 
patterns for our top 10 brands. What I would say is more surprising is that 
we don't see the number of ads they produce increase over time.

### 2. Ad Superlatives

The first ad superlative we can give is "most popular." To determine which 
has been the most popular ad, we will simply look at which ad has the greatest
number of views:
```{r}
super_bowl_ads %>%
  arrange(desc(view_count)) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = view_count, y = reorder(title, +view_count)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_number(suffix = " M", scale = 1e-6)) + 
  geom_bar(
    stat = "identity",
    fill = '#3388bd') + 
  labs(
    x = "Number of Views",
    y = "Video Title"
  )
```

Seems like we have a clear winner here: "Doritos Sling Baby" with a whopping
175 million views! The next highest ad is the Budweiser "Born the Hard Way" ad
with only a fraction of the views. Such a disparity makes me wonder if this is 
the best way to determine "popularity" but we really aren't offered any better
metric to determine this. So we'll take it for what it is and continue with some
other superlatives.

#### Most Liked and Disliked Super Bowl Commercials
To determine this, I want to create four ratios:

1. Likes to Views Ratio
2. Dislikes to Views Ratios
3. Likes to Total Reactions (Likes + Dislikes)
4. Dislikes to Total Reactions (Likes + Dislikes)

Let's do it!
```{r}
# 1 + 2: Likes/Dislikes to Views Ratios
super_bowl_ads$ratio_likes_views <- super_bowl_ads$like_count / 
  super_bowl_ads$view_count
super_bowl_ads$ratio_dislikes_views <- super_bowl_ads$dislike_count / 
  super_bowl_ads$view_count

# 3 + 4: Likes/Dislikes to Total Reactions Ratios
# First create the total reactions col
super_bowl_ads$total_reactions <- super_bowl_ads$like_count + 
  super_bowl_ads$dislike_count

# Generate the other two ratios
super_bowl_ads$ratio_likes_react <- super_bowl_ads$like_count / 
  super_bowl_ads$total_reactions
super_bowl_ads$ratio_dislikes_react <- super_bowl_ads$dislike_count /
  super_bowl_ads$total_reactions
```
