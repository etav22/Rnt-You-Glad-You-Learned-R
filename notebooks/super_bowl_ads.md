# Background

This notebook focuses on super bowl ads data! Again, this data is
retrieved from the `tidy-tuesday` collection.

To give a general overview, this dataset was curated by the team at
[FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/). Per their
[article](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/super-bowl-ads/) (which I
will refrain from reading to have a true explanatory experience), they
describe how they composed this dataset:

> We watched 233 ads from the 10 brands that aired the most spots in all
> 21 Super Bowls this century, according to superbowl-ads.com.1 While we
> watched, we evaluated ads using seven specific criteria, marking every
> spot as a ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù for each.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Setup

First, let‚Äôs load the libraries and data:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidytuesdayR) # library from which we'll retrieve the data
library(patchwork)
library(stringr)

# Let's also set a theme for our plots
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

Now let‚Äôs load the data from `tidy-tuesday` (March 2nd, 2021):

``` r
super_bowl_ads <- tt_load('2021-03-02')
```

    ## 
    ##  Downloading file 1 of 1: `youtube.csv`

``` r
super_bowl_ads <- super_bowl_ads$youtube
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

To begin, I like to just take a quick gander at the data to see what it
looks like:

``` r
head(super_bowl_ads)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 √ó 25
    ##    year brand     superbo‚Ä¶¬π youtu‚Ä¶¬≤ funny show_‚Ä¶¬≥ patri‚Ä¶‚Å¥ celeb‚Ä¶‚Åµ danger animals

    ## # ‚Ä¶ with 15 more variables: use_sex <lgl>, id <chr>, kind <chr>, etag <chr>,
    ## #   view_count <dbl>, like_count <dbl>, dislike_count <dbl>,
    ## #   favorite_count <dbl>, comment_count <dbl>, published_at <dttm>,
    ## #   title <chr>, description <chr>, thumbnail <chr>, channel_title <chr>,
    ## #   category_id <dbl>, and abbreviated variable names
    ## #   ¬π‚Äãsuperbowl_ads_dot_com_url, ¬≤‚Äãyoutube_url, ¬≥‚Äãshow_product_quickly,
    ## #   ‚Å¥‚Äãpatriotic, ‚Åµ‚Äãcelebrity

Immediately, there are a couple of columns I‚Äôd like to drop that really
won‚Äôt be useful for analysis. Those columns are:

- `superbowl_ads_dot_com_url`
- `youtube_url`
- `etag`
- `thumbnail`

I‚Äôm removing these columns since these columns are metadata that won‚Äôt
add any sort of value to our analyses.

``` r
super_bowl_ads <- subset(
  super_bowl_ads, 
  select = -c(superbowl_ads_dot_com_url,
              youtube_url,
              etag,
              thumbnail)
  )
```

Having removed those columns, let‚Äôs take a quick look to see if we have
any abnormalities like `NaN` values:

``` r
sapply(super_bowl_ads, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

    ##                 year                brand                funny 
    ##                    0                    0                    0 
    ## show_product_quickly            patriotic            celebrity 
    ##                    0                    0                    0 
    ##               danger              animals              use_sex 
    ##                    0                    0                    0 
    ##                   id                 kind           view_count 
    ##                   11                   16                   16 
    ##           like_count        dislike_count       favorite_count 
    ##                   22                   22                   16 
    ##        comment_count         published_at                title 
    ##                   25                   16                   16 
    ##          description        channel_title          category_id 
    ##                   40                   16                   16

We find that there are several missing values in the `kind` and
`view_count` which will make analyzing those rows impossible. So let‚Äôs
look at those rows and make sure that we can drop them.

``` r
# Show the number of rows in the dataframe
print(nrow(super_bowl_ads))
```

    ## [1] 247

``` r
# Let's just drop the columns which have either missing views, and like_counts
# since those are the most important from an analysis point of views
super_bowl_ads <- super_bowl_ads[!is.na(super_bowl_ads$view_count), ]
super_bowl_ads <- super_bowl_ads[!is.na(super_bowl_ads$like_count), ]

# Let's view the missing values again:
sapply(super_bowl_ads, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

``` r
print(nrow(super_bowl_ads))
```

    ## [1] 225

In total, we dropped about **22 observations**, which is not too many
considering we started with 247 observations (less than 10%).

With our data relatively clean (for analysis), let‚Äôs formulate a list of
questions we can answer regarding this dataset:

1.  Are certain types of commercials associated with a specific type of
    brand? Are they consistent their type of commercial or does it
    change over time?
2.  What are the most popular commercials? We can determine this by the
    number of views that a video received and furthermore, we can do
    some feature
3.  Does having more categories help or hurt a commercial? Tying in with
    question 2, do the most popular commercials typically have two or
    more categories? Or are they more focused on one single category?
    engineering to determine which ads have been wildly popular,
    controversial, etc.
4.  How well does youtube‚Äôs categorization match that of the
    FiveThirtyEight team?

Within each question, we will likely have further sub-questions, but for
now, let‚Äôs get started üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Ad categories over time

The categories that we‚Äôre working with are:

- `funny`
- `show_product_quickly`
- `patriotic`
- `celebrity`
- `danger`
- `animals`
- `use_sex`

Some of these are more subjective than others (`funny`,
`show_product_quickly`), but we‚Äôll trust the team at FiveThirtyEight has
a good sense of humor and is relatively impatient üòâ.

First, let‚Äôs look at who our 10 brands are

``` r
unique(super_bowl_ads$brand)
```

    ##  [1] "Toyota"    "Bud Light" "Hynudai"   "Coca-Cola" "Kia"       "Budweiser"
    ##  [7] "NFL"       "Pepsi"     "Doritos"   "E-Trade"

We have:

- 3 car brands
- 5 food/beverage brands
- 1 financial brand
- 1 sports brand

Before looking at the ad categories, how is the distribution of ads
amongst the brands?

``` r
super_bowl_ads %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  summarize(total_ads = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_ads))
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 √ó 2
    ##    brand     total_ads
    ##    <chr>         <int>
    ##  1 Bud Light        56
    ##  2 Budweiser        37
    ##  3 Pepsi            24
    ##  4 Doritos          23
    ##  5 Hynudai          22
    ##  6 Coca-Cola        20
    ##  7 E-Trade          12
    ##  8 Kia              12
    ##  9 Toyota           10
    ## 10 NFL               9

We can already see that the number of ads are heavily skewed towards our
food/beverage brands. So when we look at the categories of each of the
different ads, we should consider some sort of percentage to combat the
disparity in the number of ads between each brand.

Let‚Äôs go ahead and now create this grouping for our different
categories:

``` r
# Group the columns by each category
group_category_by_brand <- super_bowl_ads %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  summarize(
    count_funny = sum(funny),
    count_show_product_quickly = sum(show_product_quickly),
    count_patriotic = sum(patriotic), 
    count_celebrity = sum(celebrity),
    count_danger = sum(danger),
    count_animals = sum(animals),
    count_use_sex = sum(use_sex))

# Sum the columns to get a total number of categories
group_category_by_brand %>%
    mutate(sum = rowSums(across(where(is.numeric)), na.rm=TRUE))
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 √ó 9
    ##    brand     count_funny count_s‚Ä¶¬π count‚Ä¶¬≤ count‚Ä¶¬≥ count‚Ä¶‚Å¥ count‚Ä¶‚Åµ count‚Ä¶‚Å∂   sum
    ##    <chr>           <int>     <int>   <int>   <int>   <int>   <int>   <int> <dbl>
    ##  1 Bud Light          53        46       1      14      24      21      22   181
    ##  2 Budweiser          18        25      14       5       7      19       7    95
    ##  3 Coca-Cola           8        14       4       6       6      12       1    51
    ##  4 Doritos            22        21       1       4      10      10       5    73
    ##  5 E-Trade            11         7       2       0       3       4       3    30

    ##  8 NFL                 2         5       4       7       0       0       0    18
    ##  9 Pepsi              17        14       3      15       6       3      11    69
